 Dear all,<br/>
Kerala Association of Colorado is delighted to present the information on 20th Indian Dance Festival (IDF). IDF is KOAC ’s premier event. It can rightly boast of a cultural treat which not only inculcates the rich heritage and culture of India but is a treat which can be enjoyed by the performer as well as the audience with equal fervor. We invite you all to stand witness to the creative extravaganza. Let’s join hands and celebrate the great artistry and spirit of traditional dance forms from the four corners of India, which had held in its bosom one of the oldest civilization of the world. The outstanding success and existence of IDF for the past 19 years is a direct result of active participation and support by each one of you.<br/><br/>
