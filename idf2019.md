	<div style="margin-left:25px">On this 20th year of IDF, we are putting forth a platform to showcase your talents and uniqueness in your choregraphy. This year the theme is Reflection of Indian culture through Indian dance forms which tells the story of a country with a rich heritage. We are inviting our talented dancers to submit entries which portrays our theme. The dance forms can be classical, semi classical, folk dances, folk fusion etc. It can also convey a theme like National Integration, Festivals of India or any social/current affairs like Global Warming. We also realize that Bollywood dances have become a part of Indian culture. So we have opened 2 slots for Bollywood dance category. We would like to limit the slots for this category, so that we can project/showcase some of our traditional/folk dance forms which are part of our rich heritage, culture and tradition. That being said, these 2 slots will be confirmed based on the theme, uniqueness of the dance form and how well it reflects to our IDF theme - SANSKRITI.</div><br/>
