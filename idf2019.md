<div style="margin-left:25px">On this 20th year of IDF, we are putting forth a platform to showcase your talents and uniqueness in your choregraphy. <br/>This year the theme is Reflection of Indian culture through Indian dance forms which tells the story of a country with a rich heritage. <br/>We are inviting our talented dancers to submit entries which portrays our theme. The dance forms can be classical, semi classical, folk dances, folk fusion etc. <br/>It can also convey a theme like National Integration, Festivals of India or any social/current affairs like Global Warming. <br/>We also realize that Bollywood dances have become a part of Indian culture. So we have opened 2 slots for Bollywood dance category. <br/>We would like to limit the slots for this category, so that we can project/showcase some of our traditional/folk dance forms which are part of our rich heritage, culture and tradition. <br/>That being said, these 2 slots will be confirmed based on the theme, uniqueness of the dance form and how well it reflects to our IDF theme - SANSKRITI.</div>
