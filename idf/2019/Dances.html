					Nataraja is a well known sculptural symbol in India and popularly used as a symbol of Indian culture. Nataraja is a depiction of the Hindu god Shiva as the cosmic ecstatic dancer. His dance is called Tandavam or Nadanta, depending on the context of the dance. The word Nataraja is a Sanskrit term, from Nata meaning "act, drama, dance" and Raja meaning "king, lord"; it can be roughly translated as Lord of dance or King of dance. The sculpture is symbolic of Shiva as the lord of dance and dramatic arts. He is surrounded by a ring of flames, standing on a lotus pedestal, lifting his left leg and balancing over a demon shown as a dwarf who symbolizes ignorance. The dynamism of the energetic dance is depicted with the whirling hair which spread out in thin strands as a fan behind his head. The details in the Nataraja artwork have been variously interpreted by Indian scholars since the 12th-century for its symbolic meaning and theological essence.

					<h2>Bhangra Dance</h2>

					The term Bhaṅgṛā refers to the traditional dance from the Indian subcontinent originating in the Majha area of the Punjab region. The dance was associated primarily with the spring harvest festival Baisakhi, and it is from one of the major products of the harvest—bhang(hemp)—that bhangra drew its name. In a typical performance, several dancers executed vigorous kicks, leaps, and bends of the body to the accompaniment of short songs called boliyan and, most significantly, to the beat of a dhol (double-headed drum). Struck with a heavy beater on one end and with a lighter stick on the other, the dhol imbued the music with a syncopated (accents on the weak beats), swinging rhythmic character that has generally remained the hallmark of any music that has come to bear the bhangra name.

					Bharatanatyam is an Indian classical dance form. The word Bharata is a mnemonic, consisting of "bha"–"ra"–"ta". According to this belief, bha stands for bhava (feelings, emotions), ra stands for raga (melody, framework for musical notes), and ta stands for tala (rhythm). The term Natya is a Sanskrit word for "dance". The compound word Bharatanatyam thus connotes a dance that harmoniously expresses bhava, raga, and tala.
