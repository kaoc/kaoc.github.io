Dear Members,

 <div style="margin-left:10px;line-height:2">
Guidelines for participant registration:
  1. Only KAOC members are allowed to perform.
  2. Songs do not have to adhere to retro night theme â€“ any can be chosen.
  3. Due to overwhelming response, we will have two categories this year : Duet and Group.
  4. Time limit for a Duet will be 4 minutes and Group will be 7 minutes.
  5. Participants cannot combine duet and group song timings. 
     Eg: participants can sing duet in a group song, but it will count towards the 7 minute limit.
  6. Please submit your registration by February 21, 2020.
